            <div class="highlight">

            <h3>Personal Information</h3>
            <ul>

            <h3>Core App Functionality</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Task Management</strong>: Store and manage your tasks locally on your device with support for dates, optional times, and priority levels. Tasks are automatically sorted by priority (with priority 1 being the highest priority and appearing at the top of the list). New tasks automatically receive the next available priority number. When you change a task's priority, the system automatically adjusts other tasks' priorities to maintain proper ordering. Priority numbers are displayed next to task titles (e.g., "1.", "2.", "3.") in the main task list, task history view, and widgets</li>
                <li><strong>Local Notifications</strong>: Send you reminders for scheduled tasks with specific times using iOS local notifications. For tasks with times, individual notifications are scheduled. For date-only tasks, daily motivational notifications are scheduled at 9 AM (showing all tasks for the day) and 9 PM (showing remaining/incomplete tasks). Interactive notification actions include: Mark Complete, Remind in 1 Hour, Remind in Morning (8:30 AM), Remind in Afternoon (12:30 PM), and Remind at Night (9:00 PM)</li>
                <li><strong>Widget Functionality</strong>: Display task lists with priority numbers, productivity statistics, and task completion status on your device's home screen (small and medium sizes) and lock screen (accessoryInline) with interactive task completion directly from home screen widgets. Tasks in widgets are sorted by priority and display priority numbers (e.g., "1.", "2.", "3.") next to task titles</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive Home Screen Widgets</strong>: Allow you to toggle task completion directly from home screen widgets without opening the app, with a 5-second grace period for undo. Task completion changes are synced back to local storage</li>
                <li><strong>Lock Screen Widget</strong>: Displays daily task count above the time on your device's lock screen, automatically updating to show incomplete tasks for the current day</li>
                <li><strong>Background Updates</strong>: Background app refresh and processing to keep widgets synchronized with local data. Background tasks explicitly do not require network connectivity</li>
                <li><strong>Calendar Integration</strong>: Organize tasks by date with visual calendar view for date selection and provide calendar views with monthly productivity tracking</li>
                <li><strong>Productivity Tracking</strong>: Calculate and display monthly productivity scores, task completion statistics, and productivity analytics locally. Productivity scores are calculated as: (completed tasks / total tasks) × 100</li>
                <li><strong>Monthly Goals</strong>: Set and track monthly task goals (options: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50 tasks per month) for productivity motivation</li>
                <li><strong>Task History</strong>: View historical tasks with filtering options (All Time, Past, Upcoming, Custom date range) and search functionality - all data stored and processed locally</li>
                <li><strong>Deep Linking</strong>: Support for deep links from widgets to add tasks (moro://addtask) or view monthly productivity (moro://monthview) - processed locally only</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Data Protection</strong>: Your data is protected by iOS device encryption and security features, including App Group sandboxing</li>
                <li><strong>Data Filtering</strong>: The app automatically filters tasks when loading data to keep only tasks from the last 60 days and next 365 days in active memory for optimal performance. Tasks outside this range remain in storage but are not loaded into active memory</li>
                <li><strong>Input Sanitization</strong>: Task titles are sanitized to prevent security issues (HTML entities are escaped)</li>
                <li><strong>No Network Transmission</strong>: No data is transmitted from your device to any remote servers. The app works completely offline</li>
